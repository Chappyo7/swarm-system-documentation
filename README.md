# Swarm Models System Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for the Swarm Models System - an advanced AI architecture inspired by collaborative intelligence systems.

## Overview

The Swarm Models System implements a collaborative intelligence platform where multiple specialized LLM agents work together to solve complex problems through a hierarchical processing pipeline and tensor-based information exchange.

## Note on Documentation Structure

There are some redundancies in the documentation where certain components are described in multiple files. This repository will be reorganized in the future to consolidate information about each component into dedicated files.
