# Swarm Models System Documentation - Part 2

## Logic Grid System

The Logic Grid System is a specialized component within the swarm architecture designed to handle complex logical reasoning problems, particularly logic puzzles like knights and knaves problems, hat puzzles, and similar reasoning challenges.

### Core Components

1. **LogicGridLayer**: The central component that integrates all other logic grid components and provides the main interface for solving logic puzzles.

2. **ParadoxDetector**: Identifies potential paradoxes in logical statements and helps resolve contradictions.

3. **WorldModelEngine**: Creates and maintains a model of the logical world described in the problem, tracking entities, relationships, and constraints.

4. **LogicReasoningPathSelector**: Determines the optimal reasoning path to solve a logic puzzle based on the problem structure.

5. **LogicalSimilarityEnhancer**: Improves reasoning by identifying similarities between the current problem and previously solved problems stored in memory.

### Integration with Swarm System

The Logic Grid System integrates with the rest of the swarm system through:

- **MusicalStaffMemory**: Stores and retrieves logical reasoning patterns and solutions.
- **ReplicationLayer**: Enables communication between the Logic Grid components and other agents in the swarm.
- **EnhancedReasoning**: Provides a wrapper class for enhanced reasoning functionality.
- **StructuredReasoning**: Offers a structured approach to reasoning with explicit steps and verification mechanisms.

### Problem Types

The Logic Grid System can handle various types of logic puzzles:

1. **Knights and Knaves Puzzles**: Problems involving characters who either always tell the truth (knights) or always lie (knaves).
2. **Hat Puzzles**: Problems where people must deduce the color of their own hat based on limited information.
3. **River Crossing Puzzles**: Problems involving transporting items across a river with constraints.

### Logic Puzzle Detection
