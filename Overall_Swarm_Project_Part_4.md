# Swarm Models System Documentation - Part 4

## State Planning Module

The State Planning Module is a specialized component for solving sequential state-based planning problems within the swarm system. It provides a structured approach to solving problems like river crossing puzzles, Tower of Hanoi, water jug problems, and other state-based planning tasks.

### Core Components

1. **StatePlanningModule**: The central component that integrates all other components and provides the main interface for planning.
   - Manages the processing of planning problems
   - Integrates with the MusicalStaffMemory and ReplicationLayer
   - Selects appropriate state engines and search algorithms
   - Formats solutions in a human-readable way

2. **SpatialStateEngine**: Engine for problems with spatial state representations.
   - Handles river crossing puzzles
   - Manages Tower of Hanoi problems
   - Supports other spatial state problems
   - Provides state representation and transition functions

3. **Search Algorithms**: Various search algorithms for finding solution paths.
   - Breadth-first search for optimal solutions
   - Depth-first search for memory efficiency
   - A* search for heuristic-guided search
   - Other specialized search algorithms

4. **Constraint System**: System for defining and enforcing constraints on states.
   - Handles predator-prey relationships (e.g., wolf and goat)
   - Manages capacity constraints (e.g., boat capacity)
   - Enforces ordering constraints (e.g., disc size in Tower of Hanoi)
   - Provides validation functions for state transitions

5. **State Planning Detector**: Component for detecting planning problems in natural language.
   - Identifies planning problem types
   - Extracts entities and constraints
   - Determines appropriate state engine
   - Provides confidence scores for detection

### Problem Types

The State Planning Module supports the following types of planning problems:

1. **River Crossing**: Problems involving transporting objects across a river with constraints.
   - Classic wolf, goat, cabbage problem
   - Missionaries and cannibals problem
   - Jealous husbands problem
   - Other variations with different entities and constraints

2. **Tower of Hanoi**: Problems involving moving a stack of discs from one rod to another.
   - Classic Tower of Hanoi with three rods
   - Variations with different numbers of discs
   - Variations with different numbers of rods
   - Variations with different constraints

3. **Water Jug**: Problems involving measuring specific amounts of water using jugs of fixed capacity.
   - Classic water jug problem with two jugs
   - Variations with different jug capacities
   - Variations with different target amounts
   - Variations with more than two jugs

### How It Works

1. When a problem is received, the State Planning Detector analyzes it to identify the problem type and extract relevant entities and constraints.
2. Based on the detected problem type, the appropriate state engine is selected.
3. The state engine creates an initial state representation and defines valid state transitions.
4. The search algorithm explores the state space to find a path from the initial state to the goal state.
5. The solution path is formatted in a human-readable way, with explanations and insights.
6. The solution is stored in the MusicalStaffMemory for future reference.

### Implementation Details

The State Planning Module has several key implementation features:

1. **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies problem types from natural language descriptions.
   ```python
   def detect_problem_type(self, query):
       """Detect the type of planning problem from the query."""
       # Check for river crossing problem
       if re.search(r'river|cross|boat', query, re.IGNORECASE):
           entities = self._extract_entities(query)
           if len(entities) >= 2:
               return "river_crossing", 0.9, entities
       
       # Check for Tower of Hanoi problem
       if re.search(r'tower|hanoi|disc|disk|rod|peg', query, re.IGNORECASE):
           num_discs = self._extract_num_discs(query)
           if num_discs > 0:
               return "tower_of_hanoi", 0.9, {"num_discs": num_discs}
       
       # Check for water jug problem
       if re.search(r'water|jug|gallon|liter|measure', query, re.IGNORECASE):
           jug_capacities = self._extract_jug_capacities(query)
           target_amount = self._extract_target_amount(query)
           if jug_capacities and target_amount > 0:
               return "water_jug", 0.9, {"jug_capacities": jug_capacities, "target_amount": target_amount}
       
       # Unknown problem type
       return "unknown", 0.0, {}
   ```

2. **Constraint Extraction**: Extracts constraints from problem descriptions using NLP techniques.
   ```python
   def _extract_constraints(self, query, entities):
       """Extract constraints from the query for the given entities."""
       constraints = []
       
       # Check for predator-prey relationships
       for i, entity1 in enumerate(entities):
           for j, entity2 in enumerate(entities):
               if i != j:
                   # Check if entity1 can eat/harm entity2
                   if re.search(rf'{entity1}.*(?:eat|harm|attack).*{entity2}', query, re.IGNORECASE):
                       constraints.append(("predator_prey", entity1, entity2))
       
       # Check for capacity constraints
       capacity_match = re.search(r'(?:boat|raft).*(?:carry|hold|fit).*(\d+)', query, re.IGNORECASE)
       if capacity_match:
           capacity = int(capacity_match.group(1))
           constraints.append(("capacity", capacity))
       else:
           # Default capacity for river crossing is 1 (plus the operator)
           constraints.append(("capacity", 1))
       
       return constraints
   ```

3. **State Representation**: Provides efficient state representations for different problem types.
   ```python
   def _create_initial_state(self, problem_type, entities, constraints):
       """Create the initial state for the given problem type, entities, and constraints."""
       if problem_type == "river_crossing":
           # For river crossing, all entities start on the left bank (0)
           # The state is represented as a tuple of (entity_positions, boat_position)
           # where entity_positions is a dictionary mapping entity names to positions (0 for left bank, 1 for right bank)
           # and boat_position is 0 for left bank, 1 for right bank
           entity_positions = {entity: 0 for entity in entities}
           boat_position = 0
           return (frozendict(entity_positions), boat_position)
       
       elif problem_type == "tower_of_hanoi":
           # For Tower of Hanoi, all discs start on the first rod
           # The state is represented as a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple represents a rod
           # and contains the discs on that rod in order from bottom to top
           num_discs = entities["num_discs"]
           return ((tuple(range(num_discs, 0, -1)), (), ()),)
       
       elif problem_type == "water_jug":
           # For water jug, all jugs start empty
           # The state is represented as a tuple of jug contents
           jug_capacities = entities["jug_capacities"]
           return tuple(0 for _ in jug_capacities)
       
       return None
   ```

4. **Search Algorithm Selection**: Selects appropriate search algorithms for different problem types.
   ```python
   def _select_search_algorithm(self, problem_type):
       """Select the appropriate search algorithm for the given problem type."""
       if problem_type == "river_crossing":
           # For river crossing, use breadth-first search to find the shortest solution
           return self._breadth_first_search
       
       elif problem_type == "tower_of_hanoi":
           # For Tower of Hanoi, use recursive solution or breadth-first search
           return self._tower_of_hanoi_recursive
       
       elif problem_type == "water_jug":
           # For water jug, use breadth-first search
           return self._breadth_first_search
       
       # Default to breadth-first search
       return self._breadth_first_search
   ```

5. **Solution Formatting**: Formats solutions in a human-readable way with explanations.
   ```python
   def _format_solution(self, problem_type, entities, solution_path):
       """Format the solution path in a human-readable way."""
       if not solution_path:
           return "No solution found."
       
       formatted_solution = "Solution:\n\n"
       
       if problem_type == "river_crossing":
           for i, (state, action) in enumerate(solution_path):
               entity_positions, boat_position = state
               
               if i == 0:
                   # Initial state
                   formatted_solution += "Initial state:\n"
                   formatted_solution += "- Left bank: " + ", ".join(entity for entity, pos in entity_positions.items() if pos == 0) + "\n"
                   formatted_solution += "- Right bank: " + ", ".join(entity for entity, pos in entity_positions.items() if pos == 1) + "\n"
                   formatted_solution += "- Boat is at the " + ("left" if boat_position == 0 else "right") + " bank.\n\n"
               else:
                   # Action and resulting state
                   formatted_solution += f"Step {i}:\n"
                   if action:
                       formatted_solution += f"- Move {', '.join(action)} to the {('right' if boat_position == 1 else 'left')} bank.\n"
                   else:
                       formatted_solution += f"- Move the empty boat to the {('right' if boat_position == 1 else 'left')} bank.\n"
                   
                   formatted_solution += "- Left bank: " + ", ".join(entity for entity, pos in entity_positions.items() if pos == 0) + "\n"
                   formatted_solution += "- Right bank: " + ", ".join(entity for entity, pos in entity_positions.items() if pos == 1) + "\n"
                   formatted_solution += "- Boat is at the " + ("left" if boat_position == 0 else "right") + " bank.\n\n"
       
       # Add similar formatting for other problem types
       
       return formatted_solution
   ```

### Integration with Swarm System

The State Planning Module integrates with the rest of the swarm system through:

1. **MusicalStaffMemory**: The module stores successful reasoning patterns in the MusicalStaffMemory for future reference.
   - Records successful solution strategies
   - Builds a library of planning patterns
   - Enables learning from past experiences
   - Improves performance over time

2. **ReplicationLayer**: The module registers with the ReplicationLayer for coherence.
   - Enables collaborative reasoning across agents
   - Maintains consistency in planning
   - Supports distributed problem-solving
   - Facilitates information sharing among agents

3. **StateAwareReplicationLayer**: An extension of the ReplicationLayer that is aware of state-based planning.
   - Provides specialized handling for planning problems
   - Maintains state consistency across agents
   - Supports collaborative planning
   - Enables more efficient planning

4. **StatePlanningTensorBridge**: A bridge between the State Planning Module and the tensor-based representation used by the swarm system.
   - Converts state representations to tensors
   - Converts tensors back to state representations
   - Enables integration with the tensor-based swarm architecture
   - Supports efficient state manipulation

### Example

Here's an example of how the State Planning Module solves a river crossing problem:

Input:
```
A farmer needs to transport a wolf, a goat, and a cabbage across a river. The boat can only carry the farmer and one item at a time. If left unattended together, the wolf will eat the goat, and the goat will eat the cabbage. How can the farmer transport all three items across the river safely?
```

Processing:
1. The system detects this as a river crossing problem with high confidence.
2. It extracts the entities (wolf, goat, cabbage) and constraints (wolf eats goat, goat eats cabbage, boat capacity is 1).
3. It creates an initial state with all entities on the left bank.
4. It uses breadth-first search to find a solution path.
5. It formats the solution in a human-readable way.

Output:
```
FINAL ANSWER:

To transport the wolf, goat, and cabbage across the river safely, the farmer should follow these steps:

1. Take the goat across to the right bank (leaving the wolf and cabbage on the left bank).
2. Return to the left bank alone.
3. Take the cabbage across to the right bank (now the goat is on the right bank, and the wolf is on the left bank).
4. Take the goat back to the left bank (now the cabbage is on the right bank, and the wolf and goat are on the left bank).
5. Take the wolf across to the right bank (now the wolf and cabbage are on the right bank, and the goat is on the left bank).
6. Return to the left bank alone.
7. Take the goat across to the right bank.

Now all three items (wolf, goat, and cabbage) are safely on the right bank.

Explanation:
- The key insight is that the goat must never be left alone with either the wolf or the cabbage.
- The goat must be transported first because it's the only item that can be left alone with the farmer on the right bank.
- The goat must be brought back to allow transporting the other item.
- The solution requires 7 crossings in total.
```

## Session Management

The Session Management system extends the swarm architecture by providing a mechanism for maintaining context and state across multiple interactions with the same user. This system enables more coherent and personalized responses by remembering previous queries, responses, and user preferences.

### Core Components

1. **SessionManager**: The main component responsible for creating, retrieving, and managing sessions.
   - Creates new sessions for first-time users
   - Retrieves existing sessions for returning users
   - Manages session expiration and cleanup
   - Provides a consistent interface for session operations

2. **Session**: Represents a single user's interaction history and preferences.
   - Stores previous queries and responses
   - Maintains user preferences and settings
   - Tracks session metadata (creation time, last access time, etc.)
   - Provides methods for updating and accessing session data

3. **KVCachePersistence**: Enables persistence of KV cache across multiple interactions.
   - Stores KV cache for each model in the session
   - Reduces computation by reusing cached key-value pairs
   - Manages cache size and eviction policies
   - Provides efficient access to cached data

4. **MemoryIntegration**: Integrates session data with the swarm's memory systems.
   - Connects session data to MusicalStaffMemory
   - Enables personalized memory retrieval
   - Supports learning from past interactions
   - Provides context-aware memory operations

### How It Works

1. When a user sends a query, the system checks if a session exists for the user.
2. If a session exists, it is retrieved; otherwise, a new session is created.
3. The session data is used to provide context for processing the query.
4. The query and response are added to the session history.
5. User preferences and settings are updated based on the interaction.
6. The session is saved for future interactions.
7. The KV cache is persisted for efficient processing of future queries.

### Implementation Details

The Session Management system has several key implementation features:

1. **Session Creation and Retrieval**: Creates and retrieves sessions based on user identifiers.
   ```python
   def get_or_create_session(self, user_id):
       """Get an existing session or create a new one if it doesn't exist."""
       if user_id in self.sessions:
           session = self.sessions[user_id]
           session.last_access_time = time.time()
           return session
       
       # Create a new session
       session = Session(user_id)
       self.sessions[user_id] = session
       
       # Log session creation
       logger.info(f"Created new session for user {user_id}")
       
       return session
   ```

2. **Session Data Management**: Manages session data including history, preferences, and metadata.
   ```python
   def add_interaction(self, query, response):
       """Add a query-response interaction to the session history."""
       interaction = {
           "query": query,
           "response": response,
           "timestamp": time.time()
       }
       
       self.history.append(interaction)
       self.last_access_time = time.time()
       
       # Trim history if it exceeds the maximum size
       if len(self.history) > self.max_history_size:
           self.history = self.history[-self.max_history_size:]
   ```

3. **KV Cache Persistence**: Persists KV cache across multiple interactions.
   ```python
   def save_kv_cache(self, model_name, kv_cache):
       """Save the KV cache for a model."""
       self.kv_caches[model_name] = kv_cache
       
       # Update cache size
       self.kv_cache_size = sum(sys.getsizeof(cache) for cache in self.kv_caches.values())
       
       # Check if cache size exceeds the maximum
       if self.kv_cache_size > self.max_kv_cache_size:
           self._evict_oldest_cache()
   
   def get_kv_cache(self, model_name):
       """Get the KV cache for a model."""
       return self.kv_caches.get(model_name)
   ```

4. **Session Expiration and Cleanup**: Manages session expiration and cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
   ```python
   def cleanup_expired_sessions(self):
       """Clean up expired sessions."""
       current_time = time.time()
       expired_user_ids = []
       
       for user_id, session in self.sessions.items():
           if current_time - session.last_access_time > self.session_expiration:
               expired_user_ids.append(user_id)
       
       for user_id in expired_user_ids:
           del self.sessions[user_id]
           
           # Log session expiration
           logger.info(f"Expired session for user {user_id}")
       
       return len(expired_user_ids)
   ```

5. **Memory Integration**: Integrates session data with the swarm's memory systems.
   ```python
   def integrate_with_memory(self, session, musical_staff):
       """Integrate session data with MusicalStaffMemory."""
       # Extract relevant information from session history
       queries = [interaction["query"] for interaction in session.history]
       responses = [interaction["response"] for interaction in session.history]
       
       # Create a memory context from session data
       context = {
           "user_id": session.user_id,
           "queries": queries,
           "responses": responses,
           "preferences": session.preferences
       }
       
       # Store the context in MusicalStaffMemory
       musical_staff.store_memory(
           memory_type="session_context",
           content=context,
           metadata={
               "user_id": session.user_id,
               "timestamp": time.time()
           }
       )
   ```

   # Get the session history
   history = session.get_history()
   ```

2. **Integration with Swarm System**: Use session data to provide context for processing queries.
   ```python
   # Process a query with session context
   def process_query_with_session(query, user_id):
       # Get or create a session
       session = session_manager.get_or_create_session(user_id)
       
       # Get session history
       history = session.get_history()
       
       # Create a prompt with session context
       prompt = f"Previous interactions:\n"
       for interaction in history:
           prompt += f"User: {interaction['query']}\n"
           prompt += f"Assistant: {interaction['response']}\n"
       
       prompt += f"User: {query}\n"
       prompt += "Assistant:"
       
       # Process the prompt with the swarm system
       response = swarm_system.process(prompt)
       
       # Add the interaction to the session
       session.add_interaction(query, response)
       
       return response
   ```

3. **KV Cache Persistence**: Use persisted KV cache for efficient processing.
   ```python
   # Process a query with persisted KV cache
   def process_query_with_kv_cache(query, user_id, model_name):
       # Get or create a session
       session = session_manager.get_or_create_session(user_id)
       
       # Get the KV cache for the model
       kv_cache = session.get_kv_cache(model_name)
       
       # Process the query with the KV cache
       response, new_kv_cache = model.generate(query, kv_cache=kv_cache)
       
       # Save the updated KV cache
       session.save_kv_cache(model_name, new_kv_cache)
       
       # Add the interaction to the session
       session.add_interaction(query, response)

## KV Cache Persistence

The KV Cache Persistence system extends the swarm architecture by enabling the saving and loading of Key-Value (KV) cache data to and from disk. This feature significantly improves performance across sessions by maintaining optimizations and reducing redundant computations.

### Core Components

1. **KV Cache Manager**: The main component responsible for managing the KV cache.
   - Stores and retrieves KV cache data
   - Tracks cache statistics
   - Manages cache size and eviction policies
   - Provides a consistent interface for cache operations

2. **Save/Load Functions**: Functions for saving and loading the KV cache to/from disk.
   - Serializes KV cache data for storage
   - Deserializes KV cache data for loading
   - Handles file I/O operations
   - Manages cache file naming and organization

3. **Interactive Commands**: Commands for managing the KV cache in interactive mode.
   - Save: Save the current KV cache to disk
   - Load: Load the KV cache from disk
   - Clear: Clear the KV cache from memory
   - Stats: Display cache statistics

4. **Cache Statistics**: Tracking and reporting of cache performance metrics.
   - Hit rates: Percentage of cache hits
   - Cache sizes: Size of each model's cache
   - Access patterns: Frequency of cache access
   - Performance improvements: Time saved by using the cache

### How It Works

1. When the system processes a query, it first checks if a KV cache exists for the model being used.
2. If a cache exists, it is used to accelerate the processing of the query.
3. The updated KV cache is stored in memory for future use.
4. The user can save the KV cache to disk using the `save` command.
5. When starting a new session, the user can load the KV cache from disk using the `load` command.
6. The system tracks cache statistics to monitor performance improvements.
7. The user can clear the cache at any time using the `clear` command.

### Implementation Details

The KV Cache Persistence system has several key implementation features:

1. **Cache Storage and Retrieval**: Stores and retrieves KV cache data.
   ```python
   def save_kv_cache(self, cache_dir):
       """Save the KV cache to disk."""
       os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)
       
       for model_name, cache in self.kv_caches.items():
           cache_file = os.path.join(cache_dir, f"{model_name}.cache")
           
           with open(cache_file, "wb") as f:
               pickle.dump(cache, f)
           
           logger.info(f"Saved KV cache for model {model_name} to {cache_file}")
   
   def load_kv_cache(self, cache_dir):
       """Load the KV cache from disk."""
       if not os.path.exists(cache_dir):
           logger.warning(f"Cache directory {cache_dir} does not exist")
           return
       
       for cache_file in os.listdir(cache_dir):
           if cache_file.endswith(".cache"):
               model_name = cache_file[:-6]  # Remove .cache extension
               cache_path = os.path.join(cache_dir, cache_file)
               
               with open(cache_path, "rb") as f:
                   cache = pickle.load(f)
               
               self.kv_caches[model_name] = cache
               
               logger.info(f"Loaded KV cache for model {model_name} from {cache_path}")
   ```

2. **Cache Statistics Tracking**: Tracks and reports cache performance metrics.

       }
       
       for model_name, cache in self.kv_caches.items():
           model_stats = {
               "size": sys.getsizeof(cache),
               "hits": self.cache_hits.get(model_name, 0),
               "misses": self.cache_misses.get(model_name, 0),
               "hit_rate": 0.0
           }
           
           total = model_stats["hits"] + model_stats["misses"]
           if total > 0:
               model_stats["hit_rate"] = model_stats["hits"] / total
           
           stats["models"][model_name] = model_stats
           stats["total_size"] += model_stats["size"]
           stats["total_hits"] += model_stats["hits"]
           stats["total_misses"] += model_stats["misses"]
       
       total = stats["total_hits"] + stats["total_misses"]
       if total > 0:
           stats["hit_rate"] = stats["total_hits"] / total
       
       return stats
   ```

3. **Interactive Commands**: Provides commands for managing the KV cache in interactive mode.
   ```python
   def process_command(self, command):
       """Process a command in interactive mode."""
       if command == "save":
           self.save_kv_cache(self.cache_dir)
           return "KV cache saved to disk."
       
       elif command == "load":
           self.load_kv_cache(self.cache_dir)
           return "KV cache loaded from disk."
       
       elif command == "clear":

           self.cache_misses.clear()
           return "KV cache cleared."
       
       elif command == "stats":
           stats = self.get_cache_stats()
           
           result = "KV Cache Statistics:\n\n"
           result += f"Total Size: {stats['total_size']} bytes\n"
           result += f"Total Hits: {stats['total_hits']}\n"
           result += f"Total Misses: {stats['total_misses']}\n"
           result += f"Hit Rate: {stats['hit_rate']:.2%}\n\n"

           for model_name, model_stats in stats["models"].items():
               result += f"  {model_name}:\n"
               result += f"    Size: {model_stats['size']} bytes\n"
               result += f"    Hits: {model_stats['hits']}\n"
               result += f"    Misses: {model_stats['misses']}\n"
               result += f"    Hit Rate: {model_stats['hit_rate']:.2%}\n"
           
           return result
       
       return None
   ```

4. **Command Line Options**: Provides command line options for specifying the cache directory and disabling the cache.

   def parse_args():
       """Parse command line arguments."""
       parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Interactive Gemma 3 Swarm")
       parser.add_argument("--cache-dir", type=str, default="./cache_storage",
                           help="Directory for storing KV cache files")
