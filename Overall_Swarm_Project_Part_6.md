# Swarm Models System Documentation - Part 6

## Early Answer Circuit

The Early Answer Circuit is a specialized component that acts as a fast-path mechanism for handling simple queries without engaging the full swarm. It can quickly process straightforward questions, resulting in faster response times and reduced computational load, particularly for common knowledge questions and simple calculations.

### Core Components

1. **EarlyAnswer Agent**: The main agent responsible for attempting to directly answer queries without complex reasoning.
   - Processes simple queries directly
   - Provides concise, straightforward answers
   - Avoids complex reasoning chains
   - Focuses on efficiency and speed

2. **Confidence Agent**: The agent responsible for evaluating the confidence level of early answers.
   - Assesses answer quality and correctness
   - Provides numerical confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
   - Evaluates certainty of the early answer
   - Determines if the answer meets confidence thresholds

3. **Verification Agent**: The agent responsible for independently verifying the accuracy of early answers.
   - Independently checks answer correctness
   - Provides numerical verification scores (0.0-1.0)
   - Serves as a second opinion on the answer
   - Helps prevent incorrect early answers

### How It Works

1. When a query is received, it is first processed by the EarlyAnswer agent, which attempts to provide a direct answer without complex reasoning.
2. The Confidence agent then evaluates how confident it is in the early answer, providing a score between 0.0 and 1.0.
3. The Verification agent independently verifies the accuracy of the early answer, also providing a score between 0.0 and 1.0.
4. If both the confidence and verification scores exceed their respective thresholds (default: 0.6), the early answer is accepted and returned.
5. If either score is below its threshold, the query is processed by the full swarm instead.

This approach ensures that only simple queries with high-confidence answers bypass the full swarm, while more complex queries receive the full attention of all specialized agents.

### Implementation Details

The Early Answer Circuit has several key implementation features:

1. **Confidence Score Extraction**: Extracts confidence scores from model outputs.
   ```python
   def _extract_confidence_score(self, response):
       """Extract a confidence score from the response."""
       # Look for explicit confidence scores
       confidence_patterns = [
           r'confidence(?:\s+score)?(?:\s*(?:is|:))?\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)',
           r'confidence(?:\s+score)?(?:\s*(?:is|:))?\s*(\d+)%',
           r'confidence(?:\s+score)?(?:\s*(?:is|:))?\s*(\d+)/10',
           r'confidence(?:\s+score)?(?:\s*(?:is|:))?\s*(\d+)/100',
           r'confidence(?:\s+level)?(?:\s*(?:is|:))?\s*((?:very\s+)?(?:high|medium|low))',
           r'I am (\d+(?:\.\d+)?)% confident',
           r'I am (\d+(?:\.\d+)?) confident',
           r'I am ((?:very\s+)?(?:confident|certain|sure))',
       ]
       
       for pattern in confidence_patterns:
           match = re.search(pattern, response, re.IGNORECASE)
           if match:
               value = match.group(1).lower()
               
               # Handle percentage
               if pattern.endswith('%'):
                   return float(value) / 100.0
               
               # Handle X/10 format
               elif '/10' in pattern:
                   return float(value) / 10.0
               
               # Handle X/100 format
               elif '/100' in pattern:
                   return float(value) / 100.0
               
               # Handle textual confidence levels
               elif value in ['high', 'very high']:
                   return 0.9
               elif value == 'medium':
                   return 0.7
               elif value == 'low':
                   return 0.4
               elif value == 'very low':
                   return 0.2
               
               # Handle textual certainty indicators
               elif value == 'confident':
                   return 0.8
               elif value == 'very confident':
                   return 0.9
               elif value == 'certain':
                   return 0.9
               elif value == 'very certain':
                   return 0.95
               elif value == 'sure':
                   return 0.8
               elif value == 'very sure':
                   return 0.9
               
               # Handle direct numerical value
               else:
                   try:
                       return float(value)
                   except ValueError:
                       pass
       
       # If no explicit confidence score is found, use a default
       return 0.7  # Moderate confidence by default
   ```

2. **Early Answer Detection**: Detects when a query can be answered directly.
   ```python
   def detect_early_answer(self, query):
       """Detect if a query can be answered early."""
       # Process the query with the EarlyAnswer agent
       early_answer_response = self._process_with_early_answer_agent(query)
       
       # Extract the answer from the response
       early_answer = self._extract_answer(early_answer_response)
       
       # Process the answer with the Confidence agent
       confidence_response = self._process_with_confidence_agent(query, early_answer)
       
       # Extract the confidence score from the response
       confidence_score = self._extract_confidence_score(confidence_response)
       
       # If the confidence score is below the threshold, return None
       if confidence_score < self.confidence_threshold:
           return None
       
       # Process the answer with the Verification agent
       verification_response = self._process_with_verification_agent(query, early_answer)
       
       # Extract the verification score from the response
       verification_score = self._extract_verification_score(verification_response)
       
       # If the verification score is below the threshold, return None
       if verification_score < self.verification_threshold:
           return None
       
       # If both scores are above their thresholds, return the early answer
       return early_answer
   ```

3. **Agent Prompts**: Specialized prompts for each agent in the circuit.
   ```python
   def _get_early_answer_prompt(self, query):
       """Get the prompt for the EarlyAnswer agent."""
       return f"""You are an expert at providing direct, concise answers to simple questions.
       
       For the following query, provide a direct answer if the query is straightforward.
       If the query requires complex reasoning, calculations, or specialized knowledge, respond with "This query requires more analysis."
       
       Keep your answer brief and to the point. Do not show your reasoning or calculations.
       
       Query: {query}
       
       Answer:"""
   
   def _get_confidence_prompt(self, query, answer):
       """Get the prompt for the Confidence agent."""
       return f"""You are an expert at evaluating the confidence level of answers to questions.

       - 0.0 means completely unconfident (the answer is definitely wrong)
       - 1.0 means completely confident (the answer is definitely correct)
       
       Query: {query}
       
       Answer: {answer}
       
       Confidence Score (between 0.0 and 1.0):"""
   
   def _get_verification_prompt(self, query, answer):
       """Get the prompt for the Verification agent."""
       return f"""You are an expert at verifying the accuracy of answers to questions.

       - 0.0 means the answer is definitely incorrect
       - 1.0 means the answer is definitely correct
       
       Query: {query}
       
       Answer: {answer}
       
       Verification Score (between 0.0 and 1.0):"""
   ```

4. **Threshold Configuration**: Configurable thresholds for confidence and verification scores.
   ```python
   def __init__(self, recurrent_region_manager, confidence_threshold=0.6, verification_threshold=0.6):
       """Initialize the Early Answer Circuit."""
       self.manager = recurrent_region_manager
       self.confidence_threshold = confidence_threshold
       self.verification_threshold = verification_threshold
   ```
