## Progressive Agent Loader

The Progressive Agent Loader is a specialized component that optimizes resource usage by intelligently managing which agents are engaged for each query. Instead of always using all available agents, it follows a phased approach that progressively adds agents only when needed, significantly reducing computational load while maintaining answer quality.

### Core Components

1. **ProgressiveAgentLoader**: The main component responsible for implementing the progressive loading strategy.
   - Manages the phased approach to agent loading
   - Tracks confidence scores for early stopping
   - Selects appropriate agents based on query domain
   - Provides a consistent interface for query processing

2. **Domain Classification**: Component for classifying queries into relevant domains.
   - Identifies mathematical, temporal, logical, factual, and creative domains
   - Assigns confidence scores to domain classifications
   - Maps domains to specialized agents
   - Guides the progressive loading process

3. **Confidence Assessment**: Component for assessing the confidence of results.
   - Evaluates the quality of reasoning steps
   - Detects uncertainty markers in responses
   - Identifies confidence markers in responses
   - Provides confidence scores for early stopping

4. **Agent Incorporation**: Component for incorporating additional agents' perspectives.
   - Integrates new agents into the processing pipeline
   - Combines perspectives from multiple agents
   - Maintains coherence across agent contributions
   - Supports the progressive addition of agents

### Phased Approach

The Progressive Agent Loader follows a three-phase approach to query processing:

1. **Phase 1: Early Answer Detection**
   - First tries the Early Answer Circuit for simple queries
   - Uses specialized agents (EarlyAnswer, Confidence, Verification)
   - Quickly processes straightforward questions
   - Returns immediate results for simple queries

2. **Phase 2: Core Agents Only**
   - If Phase 1 fails, uses a minimal set of core agents
   - Includes FrontMan, Math, and Logic agents
   - Processes queries with essential reasoning capabilities
   - Assesses confidence for early stopping

3. **Phase 3: Progressive Agent Loading**
   - If Phase 2 fails, progressively adds specialized agents
   - Adds agents based on query domain classification
   - Reassesses confidence after each addition
   - Stops adding agents once confidence threshold is reached

### How It Works

1. When a query is received, the Progressive Agent Loader first attempts to use the Early Answer Circuit to handle simple queries (Phase 1).
2. If the Early Answer Circuit cannot handle the query with sufficient confidence, the system falls back to using a minimal set of core agents (Phase 2).
3. After processing with the core agents, the system assesses the confidence of the result. If the confidence exceeds the threshold (default: 0.85), the result is returned without engaging additional agents.
4. If the core agents cannot produce a sufficiently confident answer, the system begins adding specialized agents based on the query's domain (Phase 3).
5. The query is classified into relevant domains (mathematical, temporal, logical, factual, creative), and specialized agents for each relevant domain are added one by one.
6. After each agent is added, the confidence is reassessed. Once the confidence threshold is reached, no more agents are added.
7. This ensures that only the necessary agents are engaged for each query, minimizing resource usage while maintaining answer quality.

### Implementation Details

The Progressive Agent Loader has several key implementation features:

1. **Domain Classification**: Classifies queries into relevant domains.
   ```python
   def _classify_query_domains(self, query):
       """Classify the query into relevant domains."""
       domains = {}
       
       # Check for mathematical domain
       math_patterns = [
           r'\d+\s*[\+\-\*\/\^]\s*\d+',  # Basic arithmetic
           r'equation',
           r'formula',
           r'calculate',
           r'math',
           r'algebra',
           r'geometry',
           r'trigonometry',
           r'calculus'
       ]
       
       math_score = 0
       for pattern in math_patterns:
           if re.search(pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
               math_score += 0.2
       
       if math_score > 0:
           domains['mathematical'] = min(1.0, math_score)
       
       # Check for temporal domain
       temporal_patterns = [
           r'time',
           r'date',
           r'day',
           r'month',
           r'year',
           r'calendar',
           r'schedule',
           r'duration',
           r'period'
       ]
       
       temporal_score = 0
       for pattern in temporal_patterns:
           if re.search(pattern, query, re.IGNORECASE):
               temporal_score += 0.2
       
       if temporal_score > 0:
           domains['temporal'] = min(1.0, temporal_score)
       
       # Add similar checks for other domains
       
       return domains
   ```

2. **Confidence Assessment**: Assesses the confidence of results.
   ```python
   def _assess_confidence(self, response):
       """Assess the confidence of the response."""
       # Check for uncertainty markers
       uncertainty_markers = [
           r'not sure',
           r'uncertain',
           r'might be',
           r'could be',
           r'possibly',
           r'perhaps',
           r'maybe',
           r'unclear'
       ]
       
       uncertainty_score = 0
       for marker in uncertainty_markers:
           if re.search(marker, response, re.IGNORECASE):
               uncertainty_score += 0.1
       
       # Check for confidence markers
       confidence_markers = [
           r'confident',
           r'certain',
           r'definitely',
           r'absolutely',
           r'clearly',
           r'without doubt',
           r'sure'
       ]
       
       confidence_score = 0
       for marker in confidence_markers:
           if re.search(marker, response, re.IGNORECASE):
               confidence_score += 0.1
       
       # Calculate final confidence score
       base_confidence = 0.7  # Base confidence
       adjusted_confidence = base_confidence + confidence_score - uncertainty_score
       
       # Ensure confidence is between 0 and 1
       return max(0.0, min(1.0, adjusted_confidence))
   ```

3. **Progressive Agent Loading**: Progressively adds specialized agents based on query domain.
   ```python
   def _process_with_progressive_loading(self, query, initial_state):
       """Process the query with progressive agent loading."""
       # Start with core agents
       agents = ['FrontMan', 'Math', 'Logic']
       
       # Process with core agents
       result = self._process_with_agents(query, initial_state, agents)
       
       # Check if confidence threshold is met
       if result['confidence_score'] >= self.confidence_threshold:
           result['phase'] = 2
           return result
       
       # Classify query domains
       domains = self._classify_query_domains(query)
       
       # Map domains to specialized agents
       domain_agents = {
           'mathematical': ['Arithmetic', 'Geometry', 'Algebra'],
           'temporal': ['TimeCalculator', 'Calendar', 'DateConverter'],
           'logical': ['LogicGrid', 'Deduction', 'Inference'],
           'factual': ['FactChecker', 'Knowledge', 'Verification'],
           'creative': ['Creative', 'Brainstorm', 'Ideation']
       }
       
       # Add specialized agents progressively
       for domain, score in sorted(domains.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
           if domain in domain_agents:
               for agent in domain_agents[domain]:
                   if agent not in agents:
                       agents.append(agent)
                       
                       # Process with updated agents
                       new_result = self._process_with_agents(query, initial_state, agents)
                       
                       # Check if confidence threshold is met
                       if new_result['confidence_score'] >= self.confidence_threshold:
                           new_result['phase'] = 3
                           return new_result
       
       # If we've added all relevant agents and still haven't met the threshold,
       # return the result with the highest confidence
       result['phase'] = 3
       return result
   ```

4. **Early Answer Detection**: Attempts to use the Early Answer Circuit for simple queries.
   ```python
   def _process_with_early_answer(self, query, initial_state):
       """Process the query with the Early Answer Circuit."""
       try:
           # Create Early Answer Circuit
           early_answer_circuit = EarlyAnswerCircuit(
               recurrent_region_manager=self.manager,
               confidence_threshold=self.confidence_threshold,
               verification_threshold=self.verification_threshold
           )
           
           # Try to get an early answer
           start_time = time.time()
           early_answer = early_answer_circuit.detect_early_answer(query)
           processing_time = time.time() - start_time
           
           if early_answer:
               return {
                   'final_answer': early_answer,
                   'confidence_score': self.confidence_threshold,  # Early answers meet the threshold by definition
                   'processing_time': processing_time,
                   'phase': 1,
                   'agents_used': ['EarlyAnswer', 'Confidence', 'Verification']
               }
           
           return None
       
       except Exception as e:
           logger.warning(f"Error in early answer detection: {e}")
           return None
   ```

## Agent Architecture

The Agent Architecture is the foundation of the swarm system, defining how different agents interact, collaborate, and contribute to the overall system's capabilities. It provides a flexible and extensible framework for creating, managing, and coordinating agents with diverse specializations and responsibilities.

### Core Components

1. **Agent**: The base class for all agents in the system.
   - Defines the common interface for all agents
   - Provides basic functionality for agent operations
   - Supports registration with the system
   - Enables communication with other agents

2. **Agent Registry**: The central registry for all agents in the system.
   - Manages agent registration and deregistration
   - Provides access to agents by name or type
   - Tracks agent status and availability
   - Supports dynamic agent discovery

3. **Agent Proxy**: A proxy for agent interactions.
   - Mediates communication between agents
   - Provides a consistent interface for agent interactions
   - Handles error conditions and retries
   - Supports asynchronous communication

4. **Agent Factory**: A factory for creating agents.
   - Creates agents of different types
   - Configures agents with appropriate parameters
   - Registers agents with the registry
   - Supports dynamic agent creation

### Agent Types

The Agent Architecture supports various types of agents, each with specific responsibilities and capabilities:

1. **FrontMan**: The central coordinator agent.
   - Manages the overall query processing flow
   - Coordinates other agents' activities
   - Synthesizes the final answer from agent contributions
   - Provides a consistent interface for the system

2. **Reasoning Agents**: Agents specialized in different types of reasoning.
   - Math: Handles mathematical reasoning
   - Logic: Handles logical reasoning
   - Temporal: Handles time-related reasoning
   - Spatial: Handles spatial reasoning
   - Causal: Handles cause-and-effect reasoning

3. **Domain Agents**: Agents specialized in specific knowledge domains.
   - Science: Handles scientific knowledge
   - History: Handles historical knowledge
   - Geography: Handles geographical knowledge
   - Literature: Handles literary knowledge
   - Technology: Handles technological knowledge

4. **Utility Agents**: Agents providing utility functions.
   - Memory: Manages memory operations
   - Verification: Verifies information accuracy
   - Confidence: Assesses confidence in answers
   - Synthesis: Synthesizes information from multiple sources
   - Optimization: Optimizes system performance

### Agent Lifecycle

The Agent Architecture defines the lifecycle of agents in the system:

1. **Creation**: Agents are created by the Agent Factory.
   - The factory creates agents of the appropriate type
   - Agents are configured with necessary parameters
   - Agents are initialized with their initial state
   - Agents are prepared for registration

2. **Registration**: Agents register with the Agent Registry.
   - Agents provide their name, type, and capabilities
   - The registry assigns a unique identifier to each agent
   - Agents are added to the registry's agent database
   - Agents become available for discovery and use

3. **Operation**: Agents perform their designated functions.
   - Agents receive requests from other agents or the system
   - Agents process requests using their specialized capabilities
   - Agents generate responses or perform actions
   - Agents communicate with other agents as needed

4. **Deregistration**: Agents deregister from the Agent Registry.
   - Agents notify the registry of their intention to deregister
   - The registry removes agents from its database
   - Agents release any resources they hold
   - Agents become unavailable for discovery and use

### Agent Communication

The Agent Architecture supports various communication patterns between agents:

1. **Request-Response**: The basic communication pattern.
   - One agent sends a request to another agent
   - The receiving agent processes the request
   - The receiving agent sends a response back
   - The requesting agent processes the response

2. **Publish-Subscribe**: A pattern for broadcasting information.
   - Agents subscribe to topics of interest
   - Publishers send messages to topics
   - Subscribers receive messages from their subscribed topics
   - Multiple subscribers can receive the same message

3. **Event-Driven**: A pattern for reacting to events.
   - Agents register event handlers for specific events
   - Events are triggered by system or agent actions
   - Event handlers are called when events occur
   - Agents react to events according to their handlers

4. **Pipeline**: A pattern for sequential processing.
   - Agents are arranged in a processing pipeline
   - Each agent performs a specific step in the process
   - Output from one agent becomes input to the next
   - The pipeline produces a final result

### Implementation Details

           self.registry = registry
           
       def send_request(self, source_agent_id, target_agent_id, request):
           """Send a request from one agent to another."""
           source_agent = self.registry.get_agent(source_agent_id)

               agent = FrontManAgent(name or "FrontMan", **kwargs)
           elif agent_type == "Math":
               agent = MathAgent(name or "Math", **kwargs)
           elif agent_type == "Logic":
               agent = LogicAgent(name or "Logic", **kwargs)
           # Add more agent types as needed
           else:
               raise ValueError(f"Unknown agent type: {agent_type}")
               
           agent.register(self.registry)
           return agent
   ```

### Integration with Swarm System

The Agent Architecture integrates with the rest of the swarm system through:

1. **RecurrentRegionManager**: The system integrates with the RecurrentRegionManager to process queries with different agent configurations.
   - Registers agents with the manager
   - Processes queries with specific agent sets
   - Manages agent interactions
   - Provides a consistent interface for query processing

2. **MusicalStaffMemory**: The system integrates with the MusicalStaffMemory to provide agents with access to shared memory.
   - Agents can store information in shared memory
   - Agents can retrieve information from shared memory
   - Memory is shared across all agents
   - Agents can collaborate through shared memory

3. **ReplicationLayer**: The system integrates with the ReplicationLayer to enable agent communication and coordination.
   - Agents can send messages to other agents
   - Agents can receive messages from other agents
   - The ReplicationLayer ensures message delivery
   - Agents can collaborate through message passing

4. **Progressive Agent Loader**: The system integrates with the Progressive Agent Loader to optimize agent usage.
   - The Progressive Agent Loader manages which agents are active
   - Agents are activated based on query requirements
   - The system optimizes resource usage
   - Agents are used efficiently

### Example Usage

Here's an example of how to use the Agent Architecture:

```python
# Create an agent registry
registry = AgentRegistry()

# Create an agent factory
factory = AgentFactory(registry)

# Create agents
frontman = factory.create_agent("FrontMan")
math_agent = factory.create_agent("Math")
logic_agent = factory.create_agent("Logic")

# Create an agent proxy
proxy = AgentProxy(registry)

# Send a request from the FrontMan to the Math agent
request = {"operation": "add", "operands": [5, 7]}
response = proxy.send_request(frontman.agent_id, math_agent.agent_id, request)

print(f"Response: {response}")  # Output: Response: {"result": 12}
```

### Benefits

The Agent Architecture provides several benefits to the swarm system:

1. **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for the creation of diverse agent types with different capabilities.
   - New agent types can be added easily
   - Existing agents can be extended
   - The system can adapt to new requirements
   - Agents can be specialized for specific tasks

2. **Scalability**: The architecture supports scaling the system by adding more agents.
   - More agents can be added to handle increased load
   - Specialized agents can be added for new domains
   - The system can scale horizontally
   - Performance can be improved by adding more resources

3. **Modularity**: The architecture promotes modularity by separating concerns into different agents.
   - Each agent has a specific responsibility
   - Agents can be developed and tested independently
   - Changes to one agent don't affect others
   - The system is easier to maintain and extend

4. **Collaboration**: The architecture enables collaboration between agents to solve complex problems.
   - Agents can work together on tasks
   - Agents can share information and insights
   - Complex problems can be broken down into simpler sub-problems
   - The system can leverage the strengths of different agents

5. **Extensibility**: The architecture is designed to be extended with new agent types and capabilities.
   - New agent types can be added without changing existing code
   - Agents can be enhanced with new capabilities
   - The system can evolve over time
   - New features can be added incrementally
