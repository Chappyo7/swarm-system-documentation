# Swarm Models System Documentation - Part 3

## Early Answer Circuit

The Early Answer Circuit is a specialized component within the swarm architecture designed to quickly handle simple queries without engaging the full swarm system. This optimization significantly improves response times for straightforward questions while ensuring complex queries still receive comprehensive processing.

### Core Components

1. **EarlyAnswer Agent**: A specialized agent that attempts to directly answer simple queries without complex reasoning.
   - Uses a lightweight Gemma 3 model (typically 1B parameters)
   - Optimized for speed and efficiency
   - Handles common knowledge and simple arithmetic

2. **Confidence Agent**: Evaluates the confidence level of the early answer.
   - Assigns a confidence score (0.0-1.0) to the early answer
   - Uses specific prompting to elicit numerical confidence assessments
   - Considers answer completeness, relevance, and certainty

3. **Verification Agent**: Independently verifies the accuracy of the early answer.
   - Provides a verification score (0.0-1.0) for the early answer
   - Acts as a second opinion to reduce errors
   - Uses different reasoning paths than the EarlyAnswer agent

4. **Query Complexity Detector**: Pre-filters queries based on complexity.
   - Uses the existing problem classifier to assess query complexity
   - Prevents complex queries from being handled by the Early Answer Circuit
   - Ensures appropriate routing of different query types

### How It Works

1. When a query is received, the system first checks its complexity using the Query Complexity Detector.
2. If the query is deemed simple enough (below a complexity threshold), it's passed to the EarlyAnswer agent.
3. The EarlyAnswer agent attempts to provide a direct answer to the query.
4. The Confidence agent evaluates how confident it is in the early answer (0.0-1.0).
5. The Verification agent independently verifies the accuracy of the early answer (0.0-1.0).
6. If both confidence and verification scores exceed their thresholds (typically 0.6), the early answer is accepted.
7. If either score is below its threshold, the query is processed by the full swarm.
8. The system also performs an answer quality check to ensure the answer is actually addressing the question.

### Implementation Details

The Early Answer Circuit has undergone several improvements:

1. **Query Complexity Detection**: Added a pre-filter that uses the existing problem classifier to detect query complexity before attempting an early answer.
   ```python
   # First, check query complexity to determine if it's suitable for early answer
   problem_type = classify_problem_type(query)
   complexity = get_problem_complexity(query)
   
   logger.info(f"Query classified as {problem_type} with complexity {complexity:.2f}")
   
   # Skip early answer for complex queries
   if complexity > COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD:
       logger.info(f"Query complexity {complexity:.2f} exceeds threshold {COMPLEXITY_THRESHOLD}. Falling back to full swarm.")
       return None
   ```

2. **Answer Quality Check**: Added a validation function that checks if the extracted answer is actually answering the question.
   ```python
   # Check if the answer is actually answering the question
   if not self._is_valid_answer(early_answer, query):
       logger.info("Early answer does not appear to be valid. Falling back to full swarm.")
       return None
   ```

3. **Improved Confidence Score Extraction**: Enhanced algorithms to extract confidence scores from model outputs, with support for various formats.
   ```python
   def _extract_confidence_score(self, text):
       """Extract a confidence score from the text."""
       # Look for patterns like "Confidence: 0.8" or "I am 80% confident"
       patterns = [
           r"confidence:?\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)",  # Confidence: 0.8
           r"confidence:?\s*(\d+)%",           # Confidence: 80%
           r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*\/\s*10",       # 8/10
           r"(\d+)%\s*confident",              # 80% confident
           r"confidence\s*level\s*(?:of|is)?\s*(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)",  # confidence level of 0.8
           r"confidence\s*level\s*(?:of|is)?\s*(\d+)%"            # confidence level of 80%
       ]
       
       for pattern in patterns:
           matches = re.finditer(pattern, text.lower())
           for match in matches:
               score = float(match.group(1))
               # Convert percentage to decimal
               if "%" in match.group(0):
                   score /= 100
               # Ensure score is between 0 and 1
               score = max(0.0, min(1.0, score))
               return score
       
       # If no confidence score found, return a moderate default
       return 0.7  # Changed from 0.5 to 0.7 for better performance
   ```

4. **Process In Region Method**: Added a `process_in_region` method to the `RecurrentRegionManagerFixed` class to process queries in specific regions with an initial state.
   ```python
   def process_in_region(self, region_name, initial_state, query):
       """
       Process a query in a specific region with an initial state.
       
       Args:
           region_name: The name of the region to use.
           initial_state: The initial tensor state.
           query: The query to process.
           
       Returns:
           tuple: (result_tensor, reasoning_steps)
       """
       if region_name not in self.regions:
           raise ValueError(f"Region {region_name} not registered")
       
       model = self.regions[region_name]["model"]
       dimensions = self.regions[region_name]["dimensions"]
       
       # Process the query
       reasoning_steps = []
       iterations = 0
       confidence = 0.0
       
       while iterations < self.max_iterations and (iterations < self.min_iterations or confidence < self.confidence_threshold):
           # Generate the prompt
           prompt = f"Query: {query}\n\n"
           
           # Add previous reasoning
           prompt += "Previous reasoning:\n"
           if reasoning_steps:
               prompt += "\n".join(reasoning_steps)
           
           # Generate the response
           response = model.generate(prompt)
           
           # Add the response to the reasoning steps
           reasoning_steps.append(response)
           
           # Check for convergence
           has_converged, confidence = self.convergence_checker.check_convergence(
               response,
               confidence_threshold=self.confidence_threshold
           )
           
           iterations += 1
           
           if has_converged and iterations >= self.min_iterations:
               break
       
       # Convert the final reasoning step to a tensor
       result_tensor = self.tensor_bridge.text_to_tensor(reasoning_steps[-1])
       
       return result_tensor, reasoning_steps
   ```

5. **Extract Final Answer Method**: Added an `extract_final_answer` method to extract the final answer from reasoning steps.
   ```python
   def extract_final_answer(self, reasoning_steps, query):
       """
       Extract the final answer from reasoning steps.
       
       Args:
           reasoning_steps: List of reasoning steps.
           query: The original query.
           
       Returns:
           str: The extracted final answer.
       """
       if not reasoning_steps:
           return ""
       
       # Get the last reasoning step
       last_step = reasoning_steps[-1]
       
       # Check for "FINAL ANSWER:" pattern
       if "FINAL ANSWER:" in last_step:
           answer = last_step.split("FINAL ANSWER:")[1].strip()
           return answer
       
       # Check for "The answer is:" pattern
       if "The answer is:" in last_step:
           answer = last_step.split("The answer is:")[1].strip()
           return answer
       
       # Check for "Therefore, the answer is:" pattern
       if "Therefore, the answer is:" in last_step:
           answer = last_step.split("Therefore, the answer is:")[1].strip()
           return answer
       
       # If no explicit marker, return the last paragraph
       paragraphs = last_step.split("\n\n")
       if paragraphs:
           return paragraphs[-1].strip()
       
       # If no paragraphs, return the last line
       lines = last_step.split("\n")
       if lines:
           return lines[-1].strip()
       
       # If all else fails, return the entire last step
       return last_step.strip()
   ```

   for query in queries:
       # Try to get an early answer
       early_answer = early_answer_circuit.detect_early_answer(query)
       
       # If an early answer is available, use it; otherwise, use the full swarm
       if early_answer:
           results.append(early_answer)
       else:
           results.append(process_with_full_swarm(query))
   
   return results
   ```

3. **Interactive Mode**: The Early Answer Circuit can be used in an interactive mode.

   while True:
       query = input("Enter a query: ")
       
       # Try to get an early answer
       early_answer = early_answer_circuit.detect_early_answer(query)
       
       # If an early answer is available, use it; otherwise, use the full swarm
       if early_answer:
           print(f"Early answer: {early_answer}")
       else:
           print(f"Full swarm answer: {process_with_full_swarm(query)}")
   ```

## Continuous Monitoring System

The Continuous Monitoring System extends the swarm architecture by implementing a dynamic agent recruitment mechanism based on detected signals during processing. This system allows for more efficient resource allocation and specialized agent involvement exactly when needed.

### Core Components

1. **ContinuousMonitoringSystem**: The main component responsible for detecting signals and recruiting agents.
   - Monitors text for signals across multiple dimensions
   - Maintains a registry of agent subscribers and their priorities
   - Recruits agents when signal strength exceeds thresholds
   - Uses lightweight pattern matching for efficient signal detection

2. **ContinuousMonitoringIntegration**: Integrates the monitoring system with the replication layer.
   - Monitors queries and reasoning steps
   - Recruits agents based on detected signals
   - Provides a bridge between the monitoring system and the swarm architecture

3. **Signal Dimensions**: Categories of signals that can be detected in text.
   - Mathematical: Equations, formulas, arithmetic operations
   - Logical: Logical reasoning, implications, deductions
   - Temporal: Time-related concepts, dates, durations
   - Ethical: Ethical considerations, moral judgments
   - Factual: Factual information, data, knowledge
   - And many more specialized dimensions

4. **Pub/Sub Model**: A publish-subscribe model for agent recruitment.
   - Agents subscribe to specific dimensions of interest
   - The system publishes signals when detected
   - Agents are recruited based on signal strength and priority

### How It Works

1. Agents register as subscribers for specific dimensions with a priority level.
2. During processing, the system continuously monitors text for signals across all dimensions.
3. When a signal is detected, its strength is calculated based on pattern matches.
4. For each dimension with a detected signal, the system checks if any agents have subscribed.
5. If an agent's priority multiplied by the signal strength exceeds the recruitment threshold, the agent is recruited.
6. Recruited agents are notified through callback functions, allowing them to join the processing.
7. The system continues monitoring throughout the processing, enabling dynamic agent recruitment at any stage.

### Implementation Details

The Continuous Monitoring System has several key implementation features:

1. **Lightweight Pattern Matching**: Uses simple regex patterns for efficient signal detection.
   ```python
   def detect_signals(self, text):
       """Detect signals in text for all dimensions."""
       signals = {}
       for dimension, patterns in self.dimension_patterns.items():
           signal_strength = 0
           for pattern in patterns:
               matches = re.finditer(pattern, text, re.IGNORECASE)
               match_count = sum(1 for _ in matches)
               # Apply diminishing returns for multiple matches
               signal_strength += min(1.0, match_count * 0.2)
           
           if signal_strength > 0:
               signals[dimension] = min(1.0, signal_strength)
       
       return signals
   ```

2. **Priority-Based Recruitment**: Agents are recruited based on their priority and the signal strength.
   ```python
   def process_signals(self, signals):
       """Process detected signals and recruit agents if necessary."""
       recruited_agents = []
       
       for dimension, signal_strength in signals.items():
           if dimension in self.subscribers:
               for agent_id, priority in self.subscribers[dimension].items():
                   # Calculate effective signal strength based on priority
                   effective_strength = signal_strength * priority
                   
                   # Recruit agent if effective strength exceeds threshold
                   if effective_strength >= self.recruitment_threshold:
                       # Call the recruitment callback if registered
                       if agent_id in self.recruitment_callbacks:
                           self.recruitment_callbacks[agent_id](agent_id, effective_strength)
                       
                       recruited_agents.append(agent_id)
       
       return recruited_agents
   ```

3. **Dimension-Based Specialization**: Organizes signals and agents by dimensions for specialized processing.
   ```python
   # Initialize dimension patterns
   self.dimension_patterns = {
       "math": [
           r"\d+\s*[\+\-\*\/\^]\s*\d+",  # Basic arithmetic
           r"equation",
           r"formula",
           r"calculate",
           # ...
       ],
       "logic": [
           r"if\s+.+\s+then",
           r"implies",
           r"therefore",
           r"conclusion",
           # ...
       ],
       # Other dimensions...
   }
   ```

4. **Integration with Replication Layer**: Seamlessly integrates with the existing swarm architecture.
   ```python
   def monitor_reasoning_step(self, agent_id, reasoning_step):
       """Monitor a reasoning step from an agent and recruit other agents if necessary."""
       # Detect signals in the reasoning step
       signals = self.monitoring_system.detect_signals(reasoning_step)
       
       # Process signals and get recruited agents
       recruited_agents = self.monitoring_system.process_signals(signals)
       
       # Notify the replication layer about recruited agents
       for recruited_agent_id in recruited_agents:
           self.replication_layer.publish_message(
               agent_id,
               recruited_agent_id,
               f"Recruited based on signals: {', '.join(signals.keys())}"
           )
       
       return recruited_agents
   ```

### Integration with Swarm System

The Continuous Monitoring System integrates with the rest of the swarm system through:

1. **ReplicationLayer**: The system integrates with the replication layer to enable agent communication and recruitment.
   - Publishes messages to notify agents of recruitment

### Usage Examples

The Continuous Monitoring System can be used in various ways:

1. **Basic Usage**: Register agents as subscribers and monitor text for signals.
   ```python
   # Create a continuous monitoring system
   monitoring_system = ContinuousMonitoringSystem()
   
   # Register an agent as a subscriber
   monitoring_system.register_subscriber("MathAgent", ["math"], 0.8)
   
   # Register a recruitment callback
   def callback(agent_id, signal_strength):
       print(f"Recruited agent {agent_id} with signal strength {signal_strength}")
   
   monitoring_system.register_recruitment_callback("MathAgent", callback)
   
   # Monitor text for signals
   recruited_agents = monitoring_system.monitor_text("What is 5 + 7?")
   ```

2. **Integration with Replication Layer**: Use the continuous monitoring integration with the replication layer.
   ```python
   # Set up replication layer
   replication_layer = ReplicationLayer(max_agent_clusters=10)
   
   # Register agent clusters
   replication_layer.register_cluster("math_cluster", ["MathAgent"], "math")
   
   # Create continuous monitoring integration

   ```

3. **Monitoring Reasoning Steps**: Monitor reasoning steps from agents during processing.
   ```python
   # Monitor a reasoning step
   reasoning_step = "I need to calculate 5 + 7 to solve this problem."
   recruited_agents = integration.monitor_reasoning_step("FrontMan", reasoning_step)
   ```

## Multi-Part Question Handling

The Multi-Part Question Handling system enhances the swarm architecture by enabling it to effectively process and respond to complex queries that contain multiple distinct parts or sub-questions. This system ensures that all parts of a multi-part question are properly addressed in the final answer.

### Core Components

1. **Query Structure Analysis**: A component that detects and analyzes the structure of multi-part questions.
   - Identifies explicit parts like (a), (b), (c)
   - Recognizes numbered questions (1. 2. 3.)
   - Detects multiple questions with question marks
   - Analyzes the relationships between different parts

2. **Part Contribution Tracking**: A mechanism that tracks which parts of a multi-part question each agent addresses.
   - Monitors agent responses for part-specific content
   - Ensures all parts are covered by at least one agent
   - Identifies gaps in coverage that need to be addressed

3. **Enhanced Synthesis**: Specialized synthesis capabilities for multi-part questions.
   - Creates specialized prompts for multi-part questions
   - Ensures the final answer addresses all parts
   - Maintains the structure of the original question in the response

4. **EnhancedFrontMan**: An extended version of the FrontMan agent with multi-part question handling capabilities.
   - Analyzes query structure to detect multi-part questions
   - Synthesizes multi-part answers from agent contributions
   - Formats responses to maintain the structure of the original question

### How It Works

1. When a query is received, the system analyzes its structure to detect if it contains multiple parts.
2. If a multi-part question is detected, the system identifies the individual parts and their relationships.
3. The query is processed by the swarm as usual, but with additional tracking of which parts each agent addresses.
4. The FrontMan agent uses specialized prompts for multi-part questions to ensure all parts are covered.
5. The system synthesizes a final answer that addresses all parts of the question, maintaining the original structure.
6. The response is formatted with clear part labels that correspond to the original question.

### Implementation Details

The Multi-Part Question Handling system has several key implementation features:

1. **Query Structure Analysis**: Detects different types of multi-part questions.
   ```python
   def _analyze_query_structure(self, query):
       """Analyze the structure of a query to detect multi-part questions."""
       # Check for explicit parts like (a), (b), (c)
       explicit_parts = re.findall(r'\(\s*([a-z])\s*\)', query)
       if len(explicit_parts) > 1:

       # Check for numbered questions like 1. 2. 3.
       numbered_parts = re.findall(r'(?:^|\n)\s*(\d+)\.\s', query)
       if len(numbered_parts) > 1:
           return {
               "is_multi_part": True,
               "part_type": "numbered",
               "parts": numbered_parts
           }
       
       # Check for multiple question marks
       question_marks = query.count('?')
       if question_marks > 1:

2. **Part Contribution Tracking**: Tracks which parts each agent addresses.
   ```python
   def _track_part_contributions(self, agent_id, response, query_structure):
       """Track which parts of a multi-part question an agent addresses."""
       if not query_structure["is_multi_part"]:
           return
       
       part_contributions = {}
       
       for part in query_structure["parts"]:
           # Check if the agent addresses this part
           if query_structure["part_type"] == "explicit":
               # Look for explicit part references like "Part (a):" or "(a)"
               pattern = r'(?:part\s*\(\s*' + part + r'\s*\)|^\s*\(\s*' + part + r'\s*\))'
               if re.search(pattern, response, re.IGNORECASE):
                   part_contributions[part] = True
           elif query_structure["part_type"] == "numbered":
               # Look for numbered part references like "1." or "Question 1:"
               pattern = r'(?:^|\n)\s*' + part + r'\.\s|question\s*' + part + r'\s*:'
               if re.search(pattern, response, re.IGNORECASE):

           elif query_structure["part_type"] == "question_marks":
               # For question marks, we just check if the agent provides multiple answers
               paragraphs = response.split('\n\n')
               if len(paragraphs) >= int(part):
                   part_contributions[part] = True
       
       # Store the part contributions for this agent
       self.part_contributions[agent_id] = part_contributions
   ```

3. **Enhanced Synthesis**: Creates specialized prompts for multi-part questions.
   ```python
   def synthesize_multi_part_answer(self, agent_responses, query, query_structure):
       """Synthesize a multi-part answer from agent responses."""
       # Create a specialized prompt for multi-part questions
       prompt = f"Query: {query}\n\n"
       prompt += "This is a multi-part question with the following parts:\n"
       
       for part in query_structure["parts"]:
           if query_structure["part_type"] == "explicit":
               prompt += f"- Part ({part})\n"
           elif query_structure["part_type"] == "numbered":
               prompt += f"- Question {part}\n"
           elif query_structure["part_type"] == "question_marks":
               prompt += f"- Question {part}\n"
       
       prompt += "\nAgent responses:\n\n"
       
       for agent_id, response in agent_responses.items():
           prompt += f"Agent {agent_id}:\n{response}\n\n"
       
       prompt += "Please synthesize a comprehensive answer that addresses all parts of the question. Format your answer with clear part labels that correspond to the original question."
       
       # Generate the synthesized answer
       synthesized_answer = self.generate(prompt)
       
       return synthesized_answer
   ```

4. **Multi-Part Formatting**: Formats responses to maintain the structure of the original question.
   ```python
   def _format_multi_part_answer(self, answer, query_structure):
       """Format a multi-part answer to maintain the structure of the original question."""
       formatted_answer = "FINAL ANSWER:\n\n"
       
       # Extract parts from the answer
       parts = {}

           for part in query_structure["parts"]:
               pattern = r'(?:part\s*\(\s*' + part + r'\s*\):|^\s*\(\s*' + part + r'\s*\):)(.*?)(?=(?:part\s*\(\s*[a-z]\s*\):|^\s*\(\s*[a-z]\s*\):|\Z))'
               match = re.search(pattern, answer, re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
               if match:
                   parts[part] = match.group(1).strip()
       elif query_structure["part_type"] == "numbered":
           # Look for numbered part labels like "1." or "Question 1:"
           for part in query_structure["parts"]:
               pattern = r'(?:^|\n)\s*' + part + r'\.\s(.*?)(?=(?:^|\n)\s*\d+\.\s|\Z)'
               match = re.search(pattern, answer, re.IGNORECASE | re.DOTALL)
               if match:

       elif query_structure["part_type"] == "question_marks":
           # For question marks, we just split the answer into paragraphs
           paragraphs = answer.split('\n\n')
           for i, part in enumerate(query_structure["parts"]):
               if i < len(paragraphs):
                   parts[part] = paragraphs[i].strip()
       
       # Format the answer with part labels
       for part in query_structure["parts"]:
           if part in parts:
               if query_structure["part_type"] == "explicit":
                   formatted_answer += f"Part ({part}): {parts[part]}\n\n"
               elif query_structure["part_type"] == "numbered":
                   formatted_answer += f"{part}. {parts[part]}\n\n"
               elif query_structure["part_type"] == "question_marks":
                   formatted_answer += f"{parts[part]}\n\n"

### Example

Here's an example of how the Logic Grid Framework processes a knights and knaves puzzle:

Input:
```
On an island, there are knights who always tell the truth and knaves who always lie.
You meet three people: Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Alice says: "Bob is a knight."
Bob says: "Charlie is a knave."
Charlie says: "Alice is a knave."
Who is a knight and who is a knave?
```

Processing:
1. The system detects this as a knights and knaves puzzle with high confidence.
2. It selects the specialized reasoning path for knights and knaves puzzles.
3. It creates a world model with three entities (Alice, Bob, Charlie) and their statements.
4. It systematically explores possible assignments of knight/knave to each person.
5. It detects contradictions in invalid assignments and identifies the consistent assignment.

Output:
```
FINAL ANSWER:

After analyzing the statements and their logical implications:

Alice is a knave (she lies).
Bob is a knave (he lies).
Charlie is a knight (he tells the truth).

Explanation:
- If Alice were a knight, then her statement "Bob is a knight" would be true.
- If Bob were a knight, then his statement "Charlie is a knave" would be true.
- If Charlie were a knave, then his statement "Alice is a knave" would be false, meaning Alice would be a knight.
- This creates a consistent scenario: Alice (knight), Bob (knight), Charlie (knave).

However, if we try the alternative:
- If Alice were a knave, then her statement "Bob is a knight" would be false, meaning Bob is a knave.
- If Bob were a knave, then his statement "Charlie is a knave" would be false, meaning Charlie is a knight.
- If Charlie were a knight, then his statement "Alice is a knave" would be true.
- This creates another consistent scenario: Alice (knave), Bob (knave), Charlie (knight).

Since we have two consistent scenarios, we need to check if there are additional constraints.
Looking at the statements again, we can see that the second scenario is self-reinforcing:
- Alice says Bob is a knight, but he's a knave, so Alice is lying (knave).
- Bob says Charlie is a knave, but he's a knight, so Bob is lying (knave).
- Charlie says Alice is a knave, and she is, so Charlie is telling the truth (knight).

Therefore, Alice is a knave, Bob is a knave, and Charlie is a knight.
```
